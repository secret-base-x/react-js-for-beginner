## Top down learning technique

The top-down learning approach is a method of learning where the learner starts with a general understanding of a concept and then breaks it down into smaller, more specific components. This method is also known as "deductive learning" because the learner is presented with a general idea or rule and then deduces specific examples or applications of that rule.

It would be overwhelming to try to understand every detail all at once. A better approach would be to first learn the frequently used patterns and their corresponding outputs, without fully understanding them. Once you have a grasp of these patterns, you can then dive deeper into the details and gain a better understanding of the material.
